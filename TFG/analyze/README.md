# PrivApp

## Analysis

### Dependencies

The PrivApp analysis tool depends on the [`requests`](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) Python module to make HTTP requests.

### Running

Before execution it is necessary that the `config.yaml` file is placed in the `/home/${user}/.mitmproxy/` directory. To execute simply run the `proxy.sh` script, the output will be a pickled file: `output.log`.
